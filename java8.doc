forEach()
method in Iterable interface
Whenever we need to traverse through a Collection, we need to create an Iterator whose whole purpose is to iterate over 
and then we have business logic in a loop for each of the elements in the Collection. We might get ConcurrentModificationException if iterator is not used properly.
